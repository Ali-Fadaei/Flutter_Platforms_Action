For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs
For more information on this input, see the [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith)

* `pubspec_path`: The pubspec.yaml file path. Optional. Default: `pubspec.yaml`
* `custom_key`: a custom key for retrive from pubspec.yaml file(optional). 

### Outputs
For more information on this output, see the [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idoutputs) and the [Context and expression syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#steps-context)

* `android`: your Flutter project should Release on android platform(String Boolean)
* `ios`: your Flutter project should Release on ios platform(String Boolean)
* `web`: your Flutter project should Release on web platform(String Boolean)
* `windows`: your Flutter project should Release on windows platform(String Boolean)

* `macos`: your Flutter project should Release on macos platform(String Boolean)
* `custom_value`: value of the custom key retrived from pubspec.yaml file

### Common workflow

1. Your `pubspec.yaml` file must contain the platforms key. For example:
```yaml

  android:
  ios:
  web:
  windows:
  macos:
```

      - name: Get Target Platforms from pubspec.yaml
        id: platform_check

        with:
          custom_key: custom_key_wanted_from_pubspec.yml

      custom_key_value: ${{steps.platform_check.outputs.custom-value}}   
```
